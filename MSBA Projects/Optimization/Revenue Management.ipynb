This is because as we saw in our optimal dual variable value for the constraint of minutes, adding an additional small change in minutes at the RHS will return 0.0 improvement in our revenue. Each additional minute of manufacturing process would bring an additional marginal revenue of $USD 0. Given that the shadow price of minutes is 0, it means that the constraint is not binding. This implies that the optimal solution will not change if the constraint is relaxed. This is because the constraint is not limiting the optimal solution."
